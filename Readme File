I started this with npm init ie to initialize the npm packages.
Secondly I indtalled express, dotenv, mongoose and colors.
I also installed nodemon with npm -D nodemon.
I changed the test script in package.json to"build": "node app.js",
        "dev": "nodemon app.js"
I initialized and committed the work so far on git.
Setting up the server or starter app on app.js
Tried it out on Postman to see if it had connected and the status is 200 ok.
i created a routes folder and also created a todoRoutes.js file. In this file I created the CRUD operation routes and I ran it on Postman to confim that they were connected.
